				<p>Growing up my dad would always make a jokes about driving around in circles around Big Ben, I would laugh and imagine myself walking the streets of London. Nothing could prepare me for how amazing London actually was.</p>
        <p> Every year my family goes on a vacation and since I graduated high school in 2014 they allowed me to pick where I wanted to go that summer, obvioulsy I chose London and Ireland. </p>

			<section class="section2">
				<p>Everything in the city looks like it came out of character book, all the doors are painted a primary color and there are horses pulling carriages of tourists around. I especially loved the bright red phone booths because often when I thought of London I thought of those. </p>
