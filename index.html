    <p>When I was younger I used to lay on my bed and look at the clouds on my ceiling and imagine all the places I could go. Yes, my dad painted clouds on my walls. I always loved exploring, even if it was just down the block to the park. I think my true passion for traveling started when I was 6 years-old and my family flew to Germany. To me as a child flying in an airplane was the coolest thing in the world. </p>

    <p>People always say that you find yourself when you travel and I truly belive that. When I'm in a new country trying all the food and soaking in the culture I feel at peace. My favorite person to travel with is my sister, Emilie, because she always takes the best pictures and never fails to make me laugh.</p>

    <p>One of my favorite places I have ever been to was South Korea because the culture is so unique and the food is AMAZING! My dad travels there every month and so it was so special to see where he works and meet some of his Korean friends.</p>
